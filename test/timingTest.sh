#create a csv file with 5 columns
#( do we care what type of data are in the rows? I assume strings and ints would be good? data will be randomly generated )

#starting at 10 rows until... ( what would be a good stop? )
#  perform 4 tests for each checksum tool
#    3 columns sorted
#    random sort
#  log the average time for each checksum tool
#  (do we want to log the CHEKCSUM OK ?)
#  add 500 rows
#  delete the checksum files to check if the checksums are ok
